# APCSFinalProject
Absolutely Accurate Admissions Simulator
1. BoredOfAdmissions
2. Jasmine Wang and Charlotte (Nour) Kastoun
3. A game similar to <i> Papers, Please </i> where you (the user) play the part of an admissions officer to determine whether a student gets into Harvard, MIT, or Greendale Community College. The difficulty can be scaled depending on how much time we have but at the most basic level, you’ll receive the student’s GPA, SAT score, extracurriculars, intended major, and statement of purpose (which will be one sentence long). The user must compare this information to the rules and use that to determine what school the student will attend. This project will be done in Java first, but hopefully end up in Processing if we have the time to add visual features.
